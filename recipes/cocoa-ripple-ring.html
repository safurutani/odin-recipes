    <h2>About The Dish</h2>
    <p>My mother taught me this recipe and coincidentally my grandmother taught her as well. We make it so often thtat the recipe is permanently ingrained in my mind. I simply bake and out comes a beautifully made coffee cake. It comes out best when a ring-shaped pan is used.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This coffee cake is as good a side dish for breakfast as it is a nice, little dessert. The double layer of chocolate between the fluffy cake layers complement each other very well. It something chocolately and sweet that everyone is sure to love! In only an hour, you can have this delicious baked good ready to enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 C shortening</li>
        <li>3/4 C sugar</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 1/2 C flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2/3 C milk</li>
        <br>
        <li>Chocolate Nesquik Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F</li>
        <li>Grease the ring-shaped pan really well</li>
        <li>Mix the eggs, shortening, and sugar in a bowl until it is smooth</li>
        <li>Mix the baking powder and flour together before adding it into the bowl with the other ingredients</li>
        <li>Pour in the milk to the bowl</li>
        <li>Now mix everything together without beating too hard with the whisk but still getting a smooth consistency</li>
        <li>Spoon in or pour a small portion of the batter into the bottom of the pan. It will become the top layer so it doesn't need to be too thick.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a layer of chocolate Nesquik (however much you want) for the next layer</li>
        <li>Alternate the batter and chocolate once again. The 2nd layer or final layer of batter can be the thickest depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>Finally put it in the oven for 30-35 minutes</li>
        <li>Once it is done, carefully go around the edges of the pan with a knife or spatula to separate it</li>
        <li>Flip the pan over and out comes the cocoa ripple ring ready to be cut into and served!</li>
    </ol>
