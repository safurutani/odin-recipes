    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you need to treat yourself. I slightly tweaked a recipe that I found on instagram. I simply doubled it as the portion was not big enough to satiate my sweet tooth snacking needs. I also increased the amount of milk but not to any specific amount because the consistency can vary. It is easy enough to adjust to your liking.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 C flour</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp melted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 C milk</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>handful of chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Microwave the flour for 30 seconds (optional)</li>
        <li>Mix both the white and brown sugar with the flour and get rid of any clumps</li>
        <li>Add the salt and melted butter</li>
        <li>Add the milk in with the vanilla extract and mix altogether</li>
        <li>You may want to add more milk if the dough isn't getting soft enough or it looks too dry still</li>
        <li>Finally add a nice handful of chocolate chips or however many makes your heart content!</li>
    </ol>
